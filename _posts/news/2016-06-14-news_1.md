## Abstract
The recent advances in deep learning have boosted the research on video analysis. 

For example, convolutional neural networks have demonstrated the superiority on modeling high-level visual concepts, while recurrent neural networks have been proven to be good at modeling mid-level temporal dynamics in the video data. 

We present a few recent advances for understanding video content using deep learning techniques. Specifically, this talk will focus on translating video to sentence with joint embedding and translation, which achieves the best to-date performance in this nascent vision task. 

We will also talk about future directions for video captioning, as well as a new “Video to Language” Grand Challenge with dataset organized by Microsoft Research Asia.
